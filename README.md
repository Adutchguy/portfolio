## Description
This project is continuously in work and ever changing. Built in ReactJS and styled using scss, it utilizes a clean design and coordinated color palette. I was intentional in keeping it simple so that my information could be easily gathered. I learned a great deal about react and JavaScript in building out this application. I plan to build out even more functionality as time permits.
